If you are planning to re-use content across multiple packages (for instance an intro video, one or more quizzes, perhaps a standard thankyou page you made in Photoshop, etc) you can build a simple course just containing those elements and export it to a zip file - a template. Then, when you build your next course just drag that exported template back on and its content and quizzes and such will be appended to the course you have loaded. Then just drag the elements into the correct positions or remove the items you don't want, and you are good to go.
