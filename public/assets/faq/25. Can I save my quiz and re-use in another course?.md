You can export a **single quiz** to a JSON file by editing the Quiz and pressing the `Export to JSON` button (right next to Save). JSON is a format designed for machines to read, but humans can too. You could edit it in any text file editor such as Notepad or Sublime Text. You can then import the quiz JSON file back in to the app which will make a new copy of that quiz for you to modify. If you're having trouble re-importing your JSON file after you've edited it, make sure that it is "valid" by using a tool such as [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) which will tell you if it has any mistakes in it.

If you are planning to re-use a **set of common content** across multiple packages (for instance an intro video, one or more quizzes, perhaps a standard thankyou page you made in Photoshop, etc) you can build a simple course just containing those elements and export it to a zip file - a template. Then, when you build your next course just drag that exported template back on and its content and quizzes and such will be appended to the course you have loaded. Then just drag the elements into the correct positions or remove the items you don't want, and you are good to go.
