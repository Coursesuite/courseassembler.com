There are various packaging types all designed for specific uses. The outputs include SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 1.4, IMS Content Packaging and No Wrapper (and xAPI is coming soon).

**SCORM** ouput is ideal for Learning Managment implementation where tracking is required. Most LMS's support SCORM 1.2 so pick that if you don't know what the difference is.

**No Wrapper** packaging is ideal if you want to include the content somewhere other than in a LMS, such as a WordPress web site (typically within an iframe).

**xAPI** support is not yet an option but is forthcoming. If you require it you may choose to host your content on [Scorm Cloud](https://rusticisoftware.com/products/scorm-cloud/) which can add an xAPI wrapper to SCORM content.
