You need a Desktop browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera. Safari and Edge may work, but are not supported.

Internet Explorer 11 or below will probably catch fire!

### Mobile Devices

Mobile devices (phones, tablets, etc) generally do *not* have the memory or file system to run the app - they may work for you, but are not supported.

Content that you *export* should be fine in most cases and is often dependant on the capabilities of the system you import your package in to.
