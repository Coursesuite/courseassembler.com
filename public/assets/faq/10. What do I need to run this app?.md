You need a **Desktop browser** such as *Chrome*, *Firefox*, or *Opera*. *Safari* and *Edge* may work, but are not supported.

Internet Explorer 11 or below will probably catch fire!

If in doubt, use Chrome.

### Mobile Devices

Mobile devices (phones, tablets, etc) generally do *not* have the memory or file system to run the app - they may work for you, but are not supported.

Content that you *export* should be fine in most cases and is often dependant on the capabilities of the system you import your package in to.
