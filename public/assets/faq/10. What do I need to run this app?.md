This app runs entirely on your web browser. It was designed with a *desktop* environment in mind.

Any modern browser fom 2023 or later will be fine - Safari, Chrome, Firefox.

Your learners should be able to use any browser from the last 5 years. Encourage them to keep up to date.

Mobile devices (phones, tablets, etc) generally do *not* have the memory or file system to run the app - they <b>may work for you</b>, but are not supported.

Content that you *export* should be fine in most cases and is often dependant on the capabilities of the system you import your package in to.
