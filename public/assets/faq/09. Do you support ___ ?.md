Content (files, documents) come in; packages (zip files) go out.

### Getting content IN

We support most common office-type apps such as Microsoft Office, Open Office, Libre, Google Suite and so on. We also support a tonne of common file formats such as PDF, images, mp3 and so on. We have some support for standards-based content package formats such as IMS CP and are working on supporting as many of these as feasible. You can of course re-import any course you have published with Course Assembler (or it's predecessor `Document Ninja`). 

### Getting packages OUT

We believe that creating a reusable package is the best way forward for your content: the last thing you want is for your content is for the platform that hosts it to go out of business taking your content with it, or change its content ownership policies leaving you without your intellectual property.

We support publishing to SCORM version 1.2 and 2004 (SCORM might be an ageing format but it's very widely supported and designed with reusability and portability in mind).  We also have some support for IMS CP exporting, and you can also publish without choosing a format which gives you a package you can reuse on any web site.

We are considering support for CMI5-based formats such as xAPI.
