Course Assembler lets you quickly compile your existing content into a package that is ready to upload to your Learning Management system that supports SCORM.

Documents are (typically) split into multiple pages, and a menu or other naviagation system lets your users step through pages one at a time.

You can use most common files from all the regular sources (PDF, Microsoft, Open Office, Google, Apple, YouTube, Vimeo, etc).

You can add audio or video to spice up your pages. You can make the pages turn when the media has finished playing.

It's possible to choose various designs for the navigation. We don't modify your content, just wrap it in a layer that makes it easy for users to step through the pages. You can edit these designs yourself.

There's no collaborative features at this time. There's no AI integration to mess with your data. Your privacy is our number one concern.
