If a file format can convert to HTML5, itâ€™s a safe bet we support it. Formats with functionality, transitions and effects or embedded resources are typically included in the converted content (e.g. spreadsheets, powerpoint files with embedded video, slide transitions, etc). A list of common formats is below:

	ppt
	pptm
	pptx
	doc
	docm
	docx
	pdf
	png
	pps
	ppsx
	jpg
	gif
	bmp
	odp
	odt
	ods
	txt
	xls
	xlsm
	xlsx
	rtf
	md (markdown)
