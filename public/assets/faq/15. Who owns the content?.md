You do. 

We don't store it. In fact, it's never even uploaded to our servers. It's temporarily sent to the cloud for document conversion, but is deleted immediately afterwards. Your content is stored by your own browser, which is permanent until you reset the app. So after you are finished, remember to reset (especially if you are using a shared computer).

We do keep your email address on file, and we track some details about how you use our software (which settings are most popular so we can keep improving), and some analytics data if you're not using an adblocker, but that's all we know about you or your data.
