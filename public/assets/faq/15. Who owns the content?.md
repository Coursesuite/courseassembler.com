We don't store it.It's temporarily sent to the cloud for conversion, but is deleted immediately afterwards. Your content is stored by your own browser, which is permanent until you reset the app. So after you are finished, remember to reset (especially if you are using a shared computer).

We keep any courses on our server that you specifically tell us to store. These are tied to your licence key and only accessible to you. These are automtically deleted once your licence expires.

We do keep your email address on file, and we track some details about how you use our software (which settings are most popular so we can keep improving), and try to store abstract analytics data (nothing personally identifiable). We try to perform analytics but your adblocker probably stops us.
