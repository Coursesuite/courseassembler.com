### Most common formats are supported

If a file format can convert to HTML5, itâ€™s a safe bet we support it. Formats with functionality, transitions and effects or embedded resources are typically <b>not</b> included in the converted content (e.g. spreadsheets, slide transitions, etc). A list of common file extensions we support is shown below:

	ppt
	pptm
	pptx
	doc
	docm
	docx
	pdf
	png
	pps
	ppsx
	jpg
	gif
	bmp
	odp
	odt
	ods
	txt
	xls
	xlsm
	xlsx
	rtf
	md (markdown)

### Urls

Got your content on a Google document? Share it so that it has a public url and we can convert it to HTML5 for you. We currently support:

	google slides
	google docs

We even support converting any URL to a screenshot of the entire page, which is embedded as an image.

### Embedding content

We also support tracking for a number of urls. For instance, we can track how far through a YouTube video the user has watched and mark the page as completed after they watch 75% of it. Same deal for SoundCloud - get a page completion for listening to some or all of a file! SlideShare presentation? Yep. Imgur gallery - *sort of*! 

	youtube
	vimeo
	imgur
	slideshare
	soundcloud

### H5P

You can drag any H5P package onto CourseAssembler. You won't be able to preview it until you publish (yet!); if the H5P package emits xAPI statements, the page can be marked completed when the H5P package is completed.

### Iframes?

You _can_ embed iframes. You _can't_ track anything that goes on inside the iframe because of browser security limitations. Works with all your favorite formats, inluding many online sources. We'll convert it to be web friendly. Use the formats and editors you are comfortable with.

### PowerPoint, Google Slides & embedded videos

Many of our competitors just convert the slide pages and leave it at that.

So what happens if you embedded a YouTube video on your slide and get CourseAssembler to convert it? Would it work? **Absolutely**. We support embedded videos in PowerPoint and Google Slides. We are looking to support embedded audio as well - that's not yet ready.
