We use Google Analytics to store information about how visitors use our website so that we may make improvements and give visitors a better user experience. Google Analytics is a third-party information storage system by Google that records information about the pages you visit, the length of time you were on specific pages and the website in general, how you arrived at the site and what you clicked on. You can opt out of the usage of Google Analytics on this and all other websites using a browser plugin.

Any decent Ad-blocker will prevent these from tracking anything... just sayin!
