<h3>Audio and autoplay</h3>
<p>Popular current browsers have recently made a change where users are required to interact with a page (e.g. click on it, scroll it, tap it, etc) before the page is allowed to play audio. This stops advertisments and streaming video to blast out at you unexpectedly. This also stops pages from automatically playing any audio recorded on them. Generally once your user has launche the course the browsers considers that an interaction for all subsequent pages. Audio has been changed to match this behaviour, namely <i>Audio no longer autoplays on page load (unexpected behaviour, requires user interaction)</i>.</p>
