<h3>Sections</h3>
<p>You can now insert a <b>Section</b> in your menu which represents a visual grouping or break in the navigation structure. For themes using a drop-down list for navigation (such as the Floating or Slide navigation) this creates a grouping within the select box. For themes using a menu system such as Menu or Dock, this draws an expandable section which the user can also expand or contract. Sections also represent Scorm Objectives; each section automaitcally adds a new objective with its own score and completion status (supported in Scorm 1.2 and 2004).</p>

<p>Themes supporting Sections have also been updated to support styling of Section items - see the documentation for further details.</p>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Closed a hole where navigating to a quiz within the Continuous theme could show a blank page</li>
    <li>Bugfix where navigating using the drop-down in Floating or Slide navigating then broke navigation with the next and previous arrows.</li>
    <li>Fixed some permissions related problems storing and updating themes and removing saved courses.</li>
    <li>Re-added the ability to change the page background of videos.</li>
    <li>Fixed up re-importing most course types. Reimporting the same items multiple times still <i>problematic</i> (don't do that).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other changes</h3>
<p>Added a <b>Captioned image</b> page type. This allows the user to choose whether to inlude the Zoom functionality on images, and optionally to add text and headings to images and choose a predefined style and colouring for the page.</p>
<p><b>Removed</b> the automatic Image Zoom functionality on directly embedded images (unexpected behaviour).</p>
<p><b>Tweaked</b> the design of the score requirement slider for videos and slideshare embeds.</p>
<p><b>Added</b> the ability to show or hide the seek bar for videos (replicates the Video 2 Scorm functionality). All videos (YouTube, Vimeo and directly embedded mp4) all use the same player skin.</p>
