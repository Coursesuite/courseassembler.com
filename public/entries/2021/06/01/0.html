<h3>Themes overhaul, part 1</h3>
<p>Themes have had an <a href="/docs/?url=./01.using-the-app/02.choose-design/01.theme-basics/docs.md">overhaul</a>. The TL;DR is:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are now now primary styles that define the overall functionality of a theme.</li>
<li>Styles have a number of presets each.</li>
<li>Presets are customisable through a simple editor. (<a href="/docs/?url=./01.using-the-app/02.choose-design/02.cusomise-presets/docs.md">See documentation</a>)</li>
<li>You get a live<small>(-ish)</small> functional preview of your content. Not everything works, but it's enough to get a feel for your course.</li>
<li>You can turn things on and off (like print or navigation icons, or the completion tick).</li>
<li>Oh yeah! You can now add a <i>print</i> icon which just prints the current page. Neat!</li>
</ul>
