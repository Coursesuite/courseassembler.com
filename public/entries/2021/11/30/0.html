<h3>PowerPoint media</h3>
<p>PowerPoint media embedding broke at some point. Well, not broke as such, just the positioning of video elements over the top of slides was off. That has now been resolved. Also we are now supporting more embed options - so embedded videos should work as well as youtube, vimeo and slide audio.</p>
