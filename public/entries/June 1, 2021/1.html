<p>Anyway, here's a quick sample of the previewer showing a few themes.</p>

<p>A major problem with the old theme system was customisability. To add navigtion icons or a print button was a major issue as each theme was its own separate set of code. We even had a <a href="https://github.com/Coursesuite/courseassembler-templates">GitHub repo</a> where you could submit your own custom designs - <i>but nobody did</i>.</p>

<p>So we now have a built in concepts of <b>themes</b> and <b>presets</b>.</p>

<p><b>Themes</b> define the broad navigation style and functionality (the code that runs a course). You can select a theme, but you can't edit the code inside it (<small>yet</small>).</p>

<p><b>Presets</b> define the colours and shapes and positions of things. Presets are similar to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets - the language browsers use for web page colours and so on). So presets share some of the same language features, but are easier to write. You don't have to know anything about how code works or what the HTML is. Presets are plain text.</p>

<p>It is now much easier to customise the designs. The existing styles are still there, with some new features thrown in:</p>

<p>But there is no reason you couldn't do this, for instance:</p>

<p><i>Maybe don't do that, though.</i></p>
