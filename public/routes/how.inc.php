                        <h3>We do the heavy lifting.</h3>
                        <p>We convert your content so it works in web browsers. You never have to deal with code, or know what <a href="/features/compliant">SCORM or xAPI</a> are, or have to deal with finicky settings, or get lost in the details.</p>
                        <p>Our robots do that for you.</p>
                        <p><b>What's really happening:</b> Depending on the file format, your file may be uploaded to our server for conversion. We examine the file type, figure out the best web-friendly format, and perform one or more file conversions. It then appears inside the app. Some formats don't even get uploaded to any server - most of the time, its your browser converting and storing files. We don't keep any files that are uploaded - they are automatically removed when conversion finishes.</p>
