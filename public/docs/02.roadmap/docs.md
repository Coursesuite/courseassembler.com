We have some new features planned or under development for this app. 

* ~~Adding support for converting Google Docs / Spreadsheets / Presentations~~ Done!
* Adding support for dropping on packages produced with other Coursesuite apps
* Add support for adding an acknowledgement-style flag or button on a page so that a user is recorded as acknowleding / accepting the package
* ~~Make a multiplatform version of the app that you can run on your desktop~~ Won't Do.
* Pre-conversion options (formatting / styling related)
* Questions / Quizzes ...
* Support embedded audio and video in powerpoint presentations
