* Support turning off scrub bar on videos from YouTube and Vimeo
* Support recording video from screen capture or webcam
* ~~Support navigating to next page after audio finishes~~
* Settable options for centering and scaling tools for each page
* Ability to upload custom themes / custom players
* Ability to store, share, collaborate on and import multiple packages
* Better Markdown editor / layout, font, colour etc
* Add support for adding an acknowledgement-style flag or button on a page so that a user is recorded as acknowleding / accepting the package
* ~~Make a multiplatform version of the app that you can run on your desktop~~ Possible but won't do.
