title: Intro pages

An intro page is a special template page with a built-in design that uses the field values set on the Download tab when publishing your course. You can specify the overall design of the intro page and some colours used, and upload a course image to use. The underlaying layout or code of intro pages cannot be changed. For more comprehensive control of your page you should design an external tool and drag it on to Course Assembler as a page.
