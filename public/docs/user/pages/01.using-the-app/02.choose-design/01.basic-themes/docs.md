Once you've added and arranged all your documents, you'll need to select a design or theme for your package that best suits your needs. Simply click on a thumbnail to select a design.

**Basic** themes have a simpler visual style than the pre-built themes, but they have the advantage of customisable colours!

To change the colour, click in the text box at the top of the page. You can either click somewhere in the colour picker that appears, or type in a colour hex code (e.g: #1a2b3c) if you need a specific colour. The basic theme thumbnails will change colour accordingly, to give a small preview of how the themes will look.

## No Design

While not included in the Basic category, scrolling down to the **None** category gives us the No Design theme - this is a completely blank design with no navigation or labelling.

Since you cannot move from the first page with this theme, it's best to only use this design with single-page courses.
