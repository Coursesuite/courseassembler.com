To download your package as a zip, click on the **Download zip** button.

The button will change into a small animated circle as it gathers the settings into a file for publishing, then it should either start downloading automatically or you should be prompted to save your zip file.

Pressing the download button performs these steps:

1. Creates HTML5 files using built-in templates that reference all the required scripts for your media type.
2. Sets the completion requirement to the percentage watched requirement you set on the Completion tab.
3. Generate the appropriate IMS Manifest type for the package and include all the standard data-definition files for that package type
4. Generate a ZIP file in memory
5. Prompt you to download that ZIP file.

After you download the package, you can still go back to previous sections of the Assembler to make more changes and download again - the files are not "wiped" from your browser until you press the Reset link.
