Screenshots in the documentation don't look like what you see.

This is because we changed the visual design of our app. Even though our colours might be different, the icons and layout and functionality all remain the same. The app was previously called 'Document Scormification Ninja' and 'Document Ninja' and you may still see some reference to these in the documentation.

Use the menu to the left to navigate the documentation.
