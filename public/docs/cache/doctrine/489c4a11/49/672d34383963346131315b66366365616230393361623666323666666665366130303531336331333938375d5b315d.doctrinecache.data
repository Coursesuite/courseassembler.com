<p><img alt="Save to Cloud" src="/docs/user/pages/01.using-the-app/04.publishing-your-package/04.save-to-cloud/cloud.png" /></p>
<p>The button will change into a small animated circle as it gathers the settings into a file for publishing. When it's done, a popup will open, allowing you to connect a cloud storage service if supported by the Assembler (or just navigate to your files if you've already linked an account).</p>

<p>Once you've opened the location or folder where you want to save the package, you don't need to click on any of the files within it. Just click the blue <em>Select</em> button in the bottom right corner to save your file to the cloud.</p>

<p>! For more detailed information on how to manage the cloud storage popup, see <a href="/docs/assembler/usage/other/cloud-management">Cloud storage management</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>After you save the package, you can still go back to previous sections of the Assembler to make more changes and save again - the files are not "wiped" from your browser until you press the Reset link.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
