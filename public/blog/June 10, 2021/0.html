<h3>More minor tweaks</h3>
<p>In this update we add the ability to store a preset. These are stored server-side against your licence key. They disappear when your licence expires. So it's better value for longer licences.</p>
<p>As such, you can now also subscribe, which keeps your licence key active as long as your subscription is active. See it on the Launch menu, and read more about it below</p>
<p>You can also publish a course to be stored on the server, and pick it up again on the 'Import Zip' dialogue. Pretty useful when you are trying out variations of a course, or have a common set of pages you always apply to your courses.</p>
