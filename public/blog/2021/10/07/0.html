<h3>Internal Work</h3>

<p>The innards of CourseAssembler are changing to better support file conversions. We have shifted the busywork of file conversion to a new server location and rewritten it to work more consistently and be able to support different conversion engines going forward. Everything <b>should</b> still work the same (or better - more image formats are now supported) - but please comment below or send an email if you experience any difficulties with file conversions.</p>
