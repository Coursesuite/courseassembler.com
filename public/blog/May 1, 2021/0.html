<h3>Goodbye IE11</h3>
<p>It's time. We have dropped IE11 support everywhere, including the content player due to its ever-increasing cost on our company. It's just too expensive to support going forward.</p>
<p>If you disagree with this decision or desparately need IE11 support, clarify your reasonings and then show real-world statistics in the comments section.</p>
