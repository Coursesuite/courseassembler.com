By default [using SCORM packaging] the learner is able to return for multiple sessions before completion (depending on the features or capabilities of the hosting LMS), and the course will "remember" the last page that the user was looking at.

The page the learner last viewed is stored in the `cmi.core.lesson_location` field.

Vimeo, YouTube and SoundCloud files will also return the user to the point in time (number of seconds) they left off (not supported on some tablets due to manufacturer constraints).
