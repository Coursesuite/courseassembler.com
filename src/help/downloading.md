Pressing the download button performs these steps:

1. Loads a template package for the particular design you have selected.
2. Loads and adds each page into the menu / pages system used by the particular selected design.
3. Converts in-page file references to real files. If two files are encountered that are the same (exactly) such as images, it will re-use the existing image.
4. Discard any referenced files that are no longer used (perhaps you removed a converted page).
5. Generate the appropriate IMS Manifest type for the package and include all the standard data-definition files for that package type
6. Generate a ZIP file in memory
7. Prompt you to download that ZIP file.

You are able to make changes after you download - the files are not "wiped" from your browser until you press the Reset link.
