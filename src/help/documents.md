##Adding documents

Drag files from your desktop onto the browser to convert them. You can drag any supported file type such as Word docs, PDF's, web image formats, e-books, and much more. (Note: Drag and drop is <i>not</i> supported in IE/Edge yet).

![drop your files onto the browser](/app/css/drop_files_w.svg)

Files are converted to HTML5 and are stored in your browser forever (or until you delete them or press Reset). This means you can close your browser and come back tomorrow and the files will still be loaded and ready.

You can embed videos or links by dragging the URL from other tabs / windows, too. Each dropped item will appear in the list as its own button and represents a 'page' in the final content package. You can drop URL's from YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, Imgur, SlideShare and more.

##What the icons do
<ul class="icons">
    <li class="ninja-dropbox">Select one or more files right from your Dropbox account (not supported on iOS).</li>
    <li class="ninja-upload">Select a file by browsing your machine / device.</li>
    <li class="ninja-link">Paste in an URL such as a youtube, vimeo, slideshare, soundcloud, imgur or other supported link.</li>
    <li class="ninja-sort">Drag items up and down to change their order.</li>
    <li class="ninja-pointer">Click on items to preview, remove or rename them.</li>
    <li class="ninja-split">Multi-page documents can be split into seperate pages.</li>
    <li class="ninja-optimise">Images larger than the preview screen should be optimised. This makes the file size smaller.</li>
    <li class="ninja-marker">Some file types allow simple editing; press this to make the document editable.</li>
</ul>

##Indenting
Indenting works with menu-based layouts and has no effect on the order of items.

<ul class="icons">
    <li class="ninja-increase">You can increase or decrease the indentation beside items to create a basic heirarchy (expandable sections).</li>
</ul>
