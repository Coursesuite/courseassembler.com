# Welcome to your new React/Navi based website!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React/Navi App](https://github.com/frontarm/navi/tree/master/packages/create-react-navi-app).

Create React/Navi App is an extension to [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started), with the following features:

- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files can be imported, allowing you to write your site's contents with a mix of Markdown and JSX.
- The initial template includes the [Navi](https://frontarm.com/navi/) router, with two example routes included in the `src/pages` directory.
- The `npm run build` script has been extended to [statically render](https://frontarm.com/articles/static-vs-server-rendering/) each of your URLs, facilitating faster loading time and improved SEO for any static content.

Otherwise, create-react-navi-app is identical to create-react-app!
