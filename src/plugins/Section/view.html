    			<h2>Section Header</h2>
    			<p>A seciton header breaks up the menu structure by grouping together sets of pages. Different themes may render sections in their own way. Pages between sections map to <b>Outcomes</b> in SCORM and have no logical function when packaged for other destinations.</p>
    			<p>You can use as many section headers as you like. Section headers cannot be indented as they represent logical groupings of pages. In the 'Menu' and 'Dock' themes, sections start closed but are able to be expanded by the user. Themes with linear navigation such as 'Continuous' ignore sections during navigation but still complete and report objectives.</p>
