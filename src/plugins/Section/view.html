    			<h2>Section Header</h2>
    			<p>A seciton header breaks up the menu structure by grouping together sets of pages. Different themes may render sections in their own way. Pages between sections map to <b>Outcomes</b> in SCORM and have no logical function when packaged for other destinations.</p>
    			<p>You can use as many section headers as you like. Section headers cannot be indented as they represent logical groupings of pages.</p>
			</div>

    		<div class="container">
    			<h3>Menu-based themes</h3>
    			<p>Themes that feature a <b>menu</b> draw each section with a slight gap between each set of pages underneath the section header. Section headers can have their own style which is based an <i>Item</i>. Sections can be toggled open and closed.</p>

    		<div class="container">
    			<h3>Select-based themes</h3>
    			<p>Any theme that implements a <b>select</b> based navigation will have section headers rendered as <b>option groups</b>. These cannot be selected and are styled differently to other list items by default.</p>
    			<p><img src="select.png"></p>
			</div>

    		<div class="container">
    			<h3>Themes with linear navigation</h3>
    			<p>Section headers are ignored as they contain no content. Navigating to a section header will skip to the adjacent page in the direction of navigation.</p>
